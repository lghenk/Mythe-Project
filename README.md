# Saving Private Flint

Saving Private Flint is a better **working title** than the previous one. It will definitely probably change at the end.

Saving Private Flint is a game based on the myth Sapling & Flint. Flint suddenly diseappears, and it's up to Sapling to find him. But as he steps in the forest, Sapling finds out that it has changed, and everything is hostile. Now it's up to him to... save the world...
